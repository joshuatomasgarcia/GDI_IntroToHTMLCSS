# GDI_IntroToHTMLCSS

This is my code for the Girl Develop It Introduction to HTML/CSS Class.

You can find the link to the official GDI slides here: https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/html-intro

You can find the link to Rochelle's improved slides here: http://gdi.rochellelewis.com/

Each directory is a class, and I will add Readme files there with any additional notes if necessary.

Two good resources to learn more and practice are:

Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/

Lynda (free w/ a ABQ library card) : https://www.lynda.com/portal/Patron?org=cabq.gov
